# üéÆ NestJS Pokemon Backend üöÄ

Welcome to the NestJS Pokemon Backend! This project serves as the backend for a Pok√©mon game, providing a robust API and essential features for gameplay.

## üéØ Features

- üîê **Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The authentication service validates user credentials and generates a JWT for authenticated users. This token is used to authenticate subsequent requests from the client.

- üåç **Pok√©mon Spawning**: The application generates initial Pok√©mon spawns for each city and schedules the spawning of new Pok√©mon after a specified delay. The spawning service uses a random number generator to determine the type and location of the spawned Pok√©mon.

- üé£ **Pok√©mon Catching**: Users can catch Pok√©mon based on the provided spawn information and user data. The catching process involves a quiz-based encounter, where the user must answer a question correctly to catch the Pok√©mon.

- üêõ‚û°Ô∏èü¶ã **Pok√©mon Evolution**: Pok√©mon can evolve into more powerful forms. The evolution process is based on the Pok√©mon's level and specific evolution conditions. The evolution service updates the Pok√©mon's data when it evolves.

- üîÑ **Pok√©mon Trading**: Users can trade Pok√©mon with each other. The trading service facilitates the exchange of Pok√©mon between users. Users can offer their Pok√©mon for trade and accept trade offers from other users.

- ‚öîÔ∏è **Battle Engine**: Users can battle each other using their Pok√©mon. The battle engine calculates the outcome of each battle based on the Pok√©mon's stats, moves, and types. The battle service updates the Pok√©mon's and user's data after each battle.

- üì° **Websockets**: Real-time updates are provided to the users through websockets. The websocket service sends updates to the client whenever there is a change in the game state, such as a new Pok√©mon spawn or the outcome of a battle.

- üè≠ **Microservices**: The application is divided into multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific feature. This makes the application more scalable and easier to maintain. The microservices communicate with each other using RabbitMQ.

- üì® **RabbitMQ**: RabbitMQ is used as a message broker to facilitate communication between the microservices. Each microservice publishes messages to a RabbitMQ exchange, and the other microservices subscribe to the exchange to receive the messages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **MongoDB**: A popular NoSQL database for storing Pok√©mon and player data.
- **RabbitMQ**: A robust message broker for implementing a microservice architecture.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform for development and deployment.
- **NestJS Workspaces**: A monorepo structure for managing multiple NestJS services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine.
- You have access to a MongoDB database.
- You have RabbitMQ installed and running.
- You have Redis installed and running.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

You can set up the project locally by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the application in development mode by running `npm run start:dev`.

Alternatively, you can use Docker to set up the project:

1. Build the Docker image by running `docker build -t nestjs-pokemon-backend ..`.
2. Start the Docker container by running `docker-compose up`.

## Environment Variables
